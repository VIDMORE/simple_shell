- command line interpreter or shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B  ./hsh

[command_string | file]

.SH DESCRIPTION

simple_shell is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands. It is compiled and launched from the command line within any number of Linux versions. It contains the most basic features and functions found in the various shell programs.

.SS Overview
The simple_shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.  It is the program that is running when the user runs gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh and runs the executable file, ./hsh.The simple_shell implements a variety of features in addition to data storage, along with built functions and line editing capabilities.  It can be use in a interactive and non-interactive way. That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell returns the error code given by the last completed command followed by either ctrl-d or exit with no status code.
